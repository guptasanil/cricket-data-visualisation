# Background

I created this project as part of a college assignment which required me to submit a novel visualisation which deals with some level of complexity. I was free to choose any data set which interests me, but there should be some
rationale for visualizing it with something more elaborate than a single established chart/idiom.

Complexity can be based on various criteria, such as...
Volume: Large items (high-dimensional), many items, overall size
Variety: Multi-variate/many attributes, heterogenous, non-uniformly distributed
Structure: task is related to complex relationships between elements
Visual complexity needed for the task: e.g. prone to over-plotting, many/complex graphical elements

Novelty, here, merely means that you are NOT simply replicating an existing visualization of your chosen data. i.e. either the dataset has not
yet been visualized OR it has not been visualized in the way that you are going to visualize it. In addition, there are two essential
requirements:

## Requirement #1 : at least one of the following should apply to your result

The overall visualization uses more than one idiom, combined in a new way, OR
The visualization uses an idiom that is unique in some way e.g. combining several encoding channels or a completely new idiom

## Requirement #2: your visualization must feature at least one of the following technical elements:

Multiple facets (see Lecture 10) e.g. small multiples, or a dashboard of different idioms, OR
Dynamic/animated view (animation may be linear and passive i.e. without any input from user), OR
Interactive manipulation of the view (some form of real-time changes can be made by the user to what is show on screen)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
