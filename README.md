# Background

I created this project as part of a college assignment which required me to submit a novel visualisation which deals with some level of complexity. I was free to choose any data set which interests me, but there should be some
rationale for visualizing it with something more elaborate than a single established chart/idiom.

Complexity can be based on various criteria, such as...
Volume: Large items (high-dimensional), many items, overall size
Variety: Multi-variate/many attributes, heterogenous, non-uniformly distributed
Structure: task is related to complex relationships between elements
Visual complexity needed for the task: e.g. prone to over-plotting, many/complex graphical elements

Novelty, here, merely means that you are NOT simply replicating an existing visualization of your chosen data. i.e. either the dataset has not
yet been visualized OR it has not been visualized in the way that you are going to visualize it. In addition, there are two essential
requirements:

## Requirement #1 : at least one of the following should apply to your result

The overall visualization uses more than one idiom, combined in a new way, OR
The visualization uses an idiom that is unique in some way e.g. combining several encoding channels or a completely new idiom

## Requirement #2: your visualization must feature at least one of the following technical elements:

Multiple facets (see Lecture 10) e.g. small multiples, or a dashboard of different idioms, OR
Dynamic/animated view (animation may be linear and passive i.e. without any input from user), OR
Interactive manipulation of the view (some form of real-time changes can be made by the user to what is show on screen)

# Deployment

I used Netifly to deploy my visualisation and it is viewable at the following link:
